# Sherpa Micro

Although it's not much cheaper than purchasing a [cnc sherpa micro](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804960962034.html), this project uses a self printed version. 

The twirled gear in the sherpa micro cnc version has an undeniably stronger grip. It's available from mellow as the [BRG-VZ](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806039560393.html) Brass Reduction Gear set (not to be confused with the BSG-VZ--Brass Straight Gear), which isn't compatible with the spacing of the original annex engineering sherpa micro. (It's 4mm shorter than a bondtech RIDGA v2 gear.) 

This project uses the [Sherpa Micro Vz RIDGA + CW2 Module v. 1.1.0](https://www.teamfdm.com/files/file/757-sherpa-micro-vz-ridga-cw2-module) remix to accomodate the shorter gear, which was originally introduced to fit the extruder in the Voron StealthBurner.

Using a printed extruder also simplifies future expansion, such as adapting the filament input to bowden for compatability with the [TradRack](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/TradRack) multi-material unit.
